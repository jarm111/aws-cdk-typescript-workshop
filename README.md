# AWS CDK TypeScript Workshop

My tinkering with the official [AWS CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/)

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk destroy`     destroys deployed stack resources
